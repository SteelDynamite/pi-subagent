description: "Route here work on behavioral- and locational-agent discovery, delegation, boundaries, progress, lifecycle safety, and the locational-agent manifest."
---

Keep delegation foreground-managed: each `subagent` call launches one isolated Pi child, shows progress, waits, and returns one result. Built-in `bash` owns shell commands and Pi owns concurrent sibling tool execution. Do not add detached jobs, background polling, or command execution to this extension.

## Model configuration maintenance

Pin explicit OpenAI model selectors as `openai/<model-id>`; preserve model IDs and declared thinking levels. Behavioral `whenCallerModelId` accepts a literal model ID or a nonempty YAML list of literal IDs, not provider-qualified selectors. `thenModel: caller` preserves the immediate caller's provider; an explicit `thenModel: provider/model` pins the target provider. Bundled rules match Astra and Sol 6.1: scout uses `openai/gpt-6.1-sol` low, worker the same model medium, reviewer `openai/gpt-6-astra` xhigh. Keep conditional policy in definitions, never agent-name dispatch or speed-dependent matching. See README's behavioral caller overrides for field validation and resume semantics.

This root declares neither model nor thinking: locational selection uses `PI_SUBAGENT_LOCATIONAL_PREFERRED_MODELS` when available, otherwise the caller model.

Definitions are reread on each delegation and before each agent turn; selector edits need no reload. Extension-code changes require `/reload`; parent environment changes require restarting Pi. The visible locational manifest is a branch snapshot, not the live selector configuration.

To bootstrap a locational owner with failed provider authentication, select an authenticated caller model first. An unavailable explicit selector uses the caller immediately; a selected non-caller model may retry once with the caller after a qualifying pre-work provider failure. Preferred-model environment settings do not override explicit `model:` entries. Delegate maintenance to the owner; do not bypass boundaries when owner instructions block edits.

## Token-speed maintenance

`token-speed.ts` is a self-contained adaptation of `pi-token-speed` 0.1.0 `src/token-speed.ts` (MIT), not a runtime dependency. Golden parity fixtures in `test/fixtures/token-speed.mjs` record the reference source SHA-256. Preserve footer measurement semantics, including first-chunk omission live versus first-token subtraction at completion; do not substitute runtime-average throughput. Reference updates require explicit parity checks, not automatic sibling imports.

Keep measurement state per launch attempt, use monotonic receipt time injected through `runDelegation`, and preserve optional numeric `SingleResult.tokenSpeed` through nested caps and final tool details. Decode stdout incrementally as UTF-8 and timestamp each received chunk once before parsing; records received together must not acquire artificial timing from parsing or progress callbacks. Count only assistant text/thinking/toolcall deltas, never cumulative snapshots or nested results. Finalize from completed calls on process close; do not save an unfinished live estimate as final. Never reconstruct historical timing from the wall clock. Speed-driven publication is event-throttled (250 ms), with no timer; existing message/nested updates stay immediate.
